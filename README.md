## :woman_technologist: About Me :

I am a researcher with a keen interest in investigating the irradiation effects and the co-evolution of microstructure and properties in materials exposed to extreme conditions.


## Simulation and Modeling

In the realm of simulation and modeling, I have a strong background in:

### MOOSE-MARMOT-BISON 🦌

I have extensive experience working with MOOSE, MARMOT, and BISON, which are powerful computational tools for solving multiphysics problems and conducting simulations across various domains. My expertise in these tools extends to areas such as nuclear engineering and materials science.

### SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) 🚀

My work involves harnessing SRIM to simulate the behavior of ions in materials. This tool is invaluable for applications like ion implantation and radiation damage studies.

### LAMMPS 💥

I have hands-on experience with LAMMPS, a versatile molecular dynamics simulator. I utilize LAMMPS for modeling and simulating complex molecular interactions and materials.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

In the realm of data analysis and visualization, I excel with:

### MATLAB 📊

I leverage MATLAB for data analysis and numerical simulations. This powerful tool enables me to extract valuable insights from experimental data and model real-world phenomena.

I am proficient in several programming languages, including:

### Python 🐍

Python is my preferred language for a wide range of tasks, including data analysis, scripting, scientific computing, and machine learning. I make use of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Scikit-Learn to process, analyze, visualize data, and build machine learning models effectively.

### C++ 🚀

My experience with C++ empowers me to develop high-performance simulations and applications, particularly when dealing with computationally intensive tasks.

### SQL 📂

I use SQL for managing and querying databases, making data retrieval and analysis a seamless process.
